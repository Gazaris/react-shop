# React Frontend for a shop

This front-end was created as a display of my capabilities in React framework. The endpoint it uses to retrieve data is [this](https://github.com/scandiweb/junior-react-endpoint), which is an API built with GraphQL and the library I use to retrieve data from it is called [Opus](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tilework/opus), a light-weight alternative to more wide-spread library [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/).
